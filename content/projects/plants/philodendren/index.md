## Difficulty

- Generally easy
- If leaves turn yellow, it means overwatered
- If wilting, underwtered
- Soft or black stems: rot or root disease

## Light

- Bright indirect light
- West/east window OK
- South facing 6-8ft back

## Humidity

- Like highs to promote faster growth
- Can survive in low, but won't grow as quickly

## Watering

- Allow to get fairly dry between watering
- Weekly OK
- Allow surface of soil to drive before watering.

## Propagate

- Can be done in Water
- Take cutting below node or aerial root. Cutting with at least 2 nodes better!
