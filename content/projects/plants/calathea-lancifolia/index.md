## Difficulty

- Hard

## Light

- Low, indirect light
- Do not like a lot of direct sun
- Northern windows work well

## Humidity

-

## Watering

- 90% dry
- Not wet or sitting in water. Check soil every other day until you get the hang of it.
- No tap water! Minerals are bad. The leaves will get crispy!
- Distilled or rain water is best. Filtered is ok.

## Propagate

## Substrate

- 60/40 potting and cacti soil + perlite
- Keep moisture, but not allow for sitting in water
